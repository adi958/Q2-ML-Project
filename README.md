Cardiovascular disease prediction models often treat all input features equally, despite the fact that clinical data contains a mix of reliable objective measurements and noisy subjective patient-reported attributes. This uniform treatment can lead to biased predictions, particularly when subjective features are poorly reported or corrupted. In this paper, we study heart disease risk prediction using a clinical dataset of over 1{,}000 patients with both objective and subjective features. We first establish a strong baseline using standard logistic regression, a commonly used model in medical settings. We then propose \emph{Robust Subtype-Weighted Logistic Regression (RSW-LR)}, which explicitly separates features into objective and subjective subtypes and prioritizes learning from the objective features. Our method incorporates asymmetric regularization and priority-weighted optimization to reduce reliance on subjective inputs. Our results show that RSW-LR consistently outperforms the baseline model in accuracy and ROC-AUC, while also reducing misclassifications driven by unreliable subjective features. These findings demonstrate that feature weighting is an effective method for clinical risk prediction.
